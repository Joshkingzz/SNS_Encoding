### **Description**
This script processes the Seaborn `Tips` dataset for feature engineering and data transformation. It explores techniques like one-hot encoding, label encoding, and ordinal encoding while handling different data types.



### **Key Steps**

#### 1. **Dataset Loading**
- The dataset `Tips` is loaded from the Seaborn library, which contains information about restaurant tips.

#### 2. **Column Renaming**
- The `total_bill` column is renamed to `Bill` for better readability.

#### 3. **One-Hot Encoding**
- The categorical columns `sex` and `smoker` are encoded using `OneHotEncoder` from `sklearn`.
- The generated columns (`sex_Female`, `sex_Male`, etc.) are renamed to simpler names like `Female` and `Male`.

#### 4. **Dropping Unnecessary Columns**
- After encoding, original categorical columns (`sex`, `smoker`) are dropped to avoid redundancy.

#### 5. **Label Encoding**
- The `day` column (categorical) is encoded into numerical labels using `LabelEncoder`.

#### 6. **Ordinal Encoding**
- The `time` column is ordinally encoded, where `Dinner` is mapped as a lower value and `Lunch` as a higher value using `OrdinalEncoder`. 
- This assumes an order where `Lunch` comes after `Dinner`.

#### 7. **Final DataFrame Consolidation**
- A new DataFrame, `Featured_table`, is created by combining the encoded columns and the original dataset (after dropping redundant columns).

#### 8. **Targeted Ordinal Encoding (Optional Separate Step)**
- The script demonstrates targeted ordinal encoding on the reloaded dataset. This involves:
  - Grouping the `day` column by the mean `size` of parties.
  - Mapping the `day` column values with their respective means.
  - Dropping the `day` column after encoding.



### **Final Outputs**

#### **1. Processed Dataset (`Featured_table`):**
- Includes:
  - One-hot encoded columns (`Female`, `Male`).
  - Ordinally encoded `time`.
  - Label encoded `day`.
  - Other numerical columns (`size`, `Bill`, etc.).

#### **2. Targeted Encoding Dataset:**
- Grouped `day` column by mean `size` and replaced it with the mean values.


### **Use Cases**

#### **1. Machine Learning Preparation:**
- The processed `Featured_table` is ready for regression or classification models.
- Encoded categorical features ensure compatibility with algorithms.

#### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- Analyze relationships between tips, bill amounts, gender, smoking habits, time, and day.

#### **3. Feature Engineering:**
- The targeted ordinal encoding provides a novel representation of categorical data, especially useful for predictive modeling.
